The current literacy rate of India is 74.04%[2]Literacy in India is a key for socio-economic progress,
and the Indian literacy rate has grown to 75% (2011 figure) from 12% at the end of British rule in 1947.
[4][5] Although this was a greater than sixfold improvement, the level is well below the world average literacy rate of 84%,
[6] and of all nations, India currently has the largest illiterate population.[7] Despite government programmes,
 India's literacy rate increased only "sluggishly,"[8] and a 1990 study estimated that it would take until 2060
 for India to achieve universal literacy at then-current rate of progress.[9] The 2011 census, however, indicated
 a 2001–2011 decadal literacy growth of 9.2%, which is slower than the growth seen during the previous decade.
 
 There is a wide gender disparity in the literacy rate in India: effective literacy rates (age 7 and above) in 2011 were 
 82.14% for men and 65.46% for women. [10] The low female literacy rate has had a dramatically negative impact on family
 planning and population stabillisation efforts in India. Studies have indicated that female literacy is a strong predictor
 of the use of contraception among married Indian couples, even when women do not otherwise have economic independence.[11]
 The census provided a positive indication that growth in female literacy rates (11.8%) was substantially faster than in male
 literacy rates (6.9%) in the 2001–2011 decadal period, which means the gender gap appears to be narrowing.[12]
